# CampusCodeVault

Welcome to CampusCodeVault, a collection of coding projects that chronicle my learning journey through higher education.

## Description

**CampusCodeVault** is like a special storage place for the coding projects I made while studying for my BTech degree in Information Technology. It holds carefully made code from different times during my studies. Even though the problems these codes solve might not be here, each code file has short explanations in comments to help you understand what it does.
