/* 3. The University has to process the fees structure of
the student. The female students are given
10% waiver in their fees. The fees is calculated as follows:

Fees = Tuition_Fee + Book_fee + Placement_fees â€“ waiver

Write a program that reads the name of the student,
gender (m - male, f - female), Tuition_fee,
Book_fee, Placement_fee and computes the fees to be paid
by the student. The output should be
displayed in this format:
Name of the Student: Arthi S
Gender: F
Fee Structure:
Tuition Fee: 10000
Book Fee: 3000
Placement Fee: 5000
Total Fees: Rs. 16200 */
