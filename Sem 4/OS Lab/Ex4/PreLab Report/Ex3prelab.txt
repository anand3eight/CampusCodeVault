Study of Pthreads:

Pthreads (POSIX threads) is a multithreading API that enables you to create and manage multiple threads within a single process. Pthreads provide a standardized interface for writing multithreaded applications that can run on a variety of systems.

Thread variable creation:
To create a thread, we first need to declare a variable of type pthread_t, which is used to hold a thread ID. We can then pass this variable as an argument to the pthread_create() function, which creates a new thread and assigns a unique ID to it.

The syntax for creating a thread variable is as follows:

pthread_t thread_id;

Here's an example of how to create a thread variable:

pthread_t tid;

Thread function:
A thread function is a function that is executed by a thread. It's also known as the thread's entry point. A thread function can take any number of arguments, but it must return a void pointer.

Here's the syntax for creating a thread function:

void *thread_function(void *arg) {
// thread function code here
}

In this example, the thread function takes a single argument of type void pointer. This argument can be used to pass data to the thread function.

Thread call:
To create a new thread and execute a thread function, we use the pthread_create() function. The pthread_create() function takes four arguments:

pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, thread_function, NULL);

The first argument is a pointer to the thread ID variable that we declared earlier. The second argument is a pointer to a pthread_attr_t structure, which we can use to specify various attributes of the new thread. If we don't need to set any attributes, we can pass NULL for this argument. The third argument is a pointer to the thread function that we want to execute. Finally, the fourth argument is a pointer to any arguments that we want to pass to the thread function.

Here's an example of how to create a new thread and execute a thread function:

pthread_t tid;
pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread_function, NULL);

In this example, we're creating a new thread with the pthread_create() function and passing the thread ID variable, tid, as the first argument. We're also passing NULL for the pthread_attr_t structure, and we're passing NULL for the argument to the thread function.

Thread join:
Once a thread has finished executing, we need to join it back to the main thread using the pthread_join() function. This function takes two arguments:

pthread_join(thread_id, NULL);

The first argument is the ID of the thread that we want to join. The second argument is a pointer to a void pointer, which we can use to retrieve the return value of the thread function. If we don't need to retrieve the return value, we can pass NULL for this argument.

Here's an example of how to join a thread back to the main thread:

pthread_t tid;
pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread_function, NULL);
pthread_join(tid, NULL);

In this example, we're creating a new thread and executing a thread function using the pthread_create() function. We're then joining the thread back to the main thread using the pthread_join() function.
